This is project which implements the function of a Tachometer.
A tachometer (revolution-counter, tach, rev-counter, RPM gauge) is an instrument measuring the rotation speed of a shaft or disk, 
as in a motor or other machine. The device usually displays the revolutions per minute (RPM) on a calibrated analogue dial, 
but digital displays are increasingly common.
Here is an example of digital tachometer using IR sensor and a microcontroller to control and display the speed of any rotating device.
